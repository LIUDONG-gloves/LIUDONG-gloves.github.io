# Challenge: Factors that may influence the fertility desire in China     

I downloaded the CGSS data version 2015 to take a detailed look into contributors for Chinese birth preference, make some primary selection on potential independent variables based on our common knowledge, then I formed a dta file. Now let me illustrate the logic why I choose those feature variables as our regressors.    

There are a number of available independent factors to be chosen, taking into the feature into account, I divide the possible choices into several dimensions, such as religion, household income, education, and political orientation, the list is going on. Since I have got known about the basic direction, I just spilit this big picture into dozens of detail ones and finally, I construct a matrix that contains exactly fifty explaining variables, as well as one explained variable, the fertility desire which illustrates how many kids one wants to give birth to without One-Child policy limitation.     

In my dataset the target variable is denoted as a371, and all the other facrors, discrete or not, are feature variables. I'll put an appendix to tell the meaning of those fifty contributors. Now Let's first look at the OLS regression result:
