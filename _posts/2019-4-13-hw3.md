# Some details about the K-nearest neighbors( KNN )       

KNN was proposed by Hart and Cover, whose original purpose is accomplishing the text classsification work. [1] The 
basic principle behind this algorithm is that, for a given unclassified sample X, we can calculate the likelihood between X and the training set then find K samples that are most similar with the sample X, therefore we are now able to estimate the value of X based on the most common labels among the chosen K samples.
